The breakpoint will be displayed in the gutter using a red marker.\n\nExecute start-resume (F5) again to resume debugging or use the step-next (F10), step-in (F11) or step-out (shift-F11) commands.\n\n## Commands\n\nYou may access the commands using CMD/Ctrl+p or by using the shortcut key specified within the brackets.\n\n```js\n'node-debugger:start-resume' (F5)\n'node-debugger:stop' (shift-F5)\n'node-debugger:toggle-breakpoint' (F9)\n'node-debugger:step-next' (F10)\n'node-debugger:step-in' (F11)\n'node-debugger:step-out' (shift-F11)\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe following attributes can be set to control the node-debugger.\n\n* nodePath - path to node.js executable\n* appArgs - arguments sent to the application during launch\n* debugPort - the port used to communicate to the launched process\n \n```js\n\"atom-node-debugger\":\n  nodePath: \"C:/program/nodejs/node.exe\"\n  appArgs: \"\"\n  debugPort: 5860\n```\n\n## Feedback\n\nPlease click [here](https://github.com/kiddkai/atom-node-debugger/issues/new)\nto provide me more suggestions to improve this debugger, thanks :D\n\n## Todo\n\n```js\nCoffeeScript support\nError Handling\n```\n\n## Known issues\n\nIn `Node.js>=0.12` and `io.js`. The process doesn't stop when your process finished.\nSo it will have no response from debugger server and will not keep going debugging.\nWhen you face that issue, just use the `x` button to stop the process by yourself.\n\nIssue report is here: https://github.com/nodejs/io.js/issues/1788\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/kiddkai/atom-node-debugger/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/kiddkai/atom-node-debugger","_id":"node-debugger@1.1.0","_shasum":"95f1de8ab4232fed53b18872a9dba8de495fb5f4","_resolved":"file:../d-115523-754-ln8eqs/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115523-754-ln8eqs/package.tgz"}
